# Accountability Prompt – Synthetic Example

In the accountability condition, before finalizing a decision, the facilitator reads:

> "Before we lock this in, please state who will be accountable for this decision
> and why this option is the right one. If anyone has concerns or alternative
> suggestions, now is the time to raise them."

This matches the accountability condition described in the proposal.
