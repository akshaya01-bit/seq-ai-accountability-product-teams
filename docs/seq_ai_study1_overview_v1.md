# Study 1 Overview – Sequencing AI Recommendations and Accountability Practices

This document summarizes Study 1 accompanying the proposal:

**Sequencing AI Recommendations and Accountability Practices in Product Teams:
Algorithmic Authority, Junior Voice, and Psychological Safety.**

## Design summary

- Setting: product / engineering / operations teams using AI copilots
- Design: 3 × 2 factorial field experiment at the agenda-item level  
  - Sequencing: AI-first vs. human-first vs. interleaved  
  - Accountability: accountability prompt vs. no prompt
- Outcomes:
  - Junior critical participation on high-stakes agenda items
  - Decision revisions
  - Perceived authority of AI vs. human teammates
  - Team psychological safety / junior voice climate

## Data in this repository (synthetic)

Version 1 includes **only synthetic data** that mimics the planned design:

- `data/raw/meetings_synthetic_v1.csv`
- `data/processed/agenda_item_panel_synthetic_v1.csv`

These files are randomly generated for illustration and **do not contain any
real organizational or pilot data**.

## OSF

Later, I may create an OSF project to:

- host the PDF of this proposal
- link to this GitHub repository

The OSF link will be added here once that page exists.
